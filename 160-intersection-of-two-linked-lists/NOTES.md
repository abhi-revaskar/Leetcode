* Brute Force - O(mxn)
* Better - O(m+n) , O(n) space, Using Hashing the addresses.
* Optimal 1 - Calculate the lengths of both the lists, move the ptr to longer list by the difference. Then check if ptr1 and ptr2 are same or not.
* Optimal 2 - Take two ptrs d1 and d2 and point them to the heads of both the lists. Move both ptrs until the ptr to shorter list reaches null. When ptr to shorter list(say d1) reaches null, the ptr to longer list(say d2) has moved n places, where n=len(shorter list). Make the ptr to shorter list (d1 which is null now) to point to the head to longer list. Now the difference between d1 and d2 is n places. Keep on moving both ptrs until d2 reaches null. When d2 reaches null, d1 will be standing at n places before the end of the longer list. Make d2 point to the head of shorter list. Now both d1 and d2 point to the nodes which are at the same distance (n) from the end. We move both the ptrs until they are equal. If the two lists intersect, d1 and d2 will point to the same non-null node, else they both will point to null.
